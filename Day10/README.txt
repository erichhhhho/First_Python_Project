The FisherFace.py would be the soulution of PartII for Assignment5.

The directory has been set to '../face/test' ot '../face/train'. And if the program don't work, maybe you should change the relative directory into absolute directory. 

FisherFace.py has been run in Pycharm and Spyder in Windows8.1 + Python3 ,both work well.

Assignment5.pdf contains the solution for both PartI and PartII.

Thank you so much for reading this and grateful to your assistance on biometrics study in NUS Summer!
