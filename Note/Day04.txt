Median filter ->good job

Convolution(SinalProcessing.pdf)

Morphology operation e.g for edge dectection(close the gap)
(joint edge broken edges )
maybe can prove if it is edge or not in mathematics

edge detection (OpenCV Canny,Prewitt)


Hough Transform(not often use)


How to do Glowing edges:
1.find edges
2.Clean up edges(e.g Morphology)
3.Thicken come edges
4.Treat edge map as mask, multiply with the original image (HSV,change the S channel, so that you can change the saturation, etc)

maybe the texture manipulation is necessary
